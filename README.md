# Generate Targeted Perturbations: Targeted Adversarial Attack via Generative Perturbations

> code is modified from [On Generating Transferable Targeted Perturbations (ICCV'21)](https://github.com/Muzammal-Naseer/TTP)

## Data Setting

You can run the code on your own ImageNet data to create the trainset by following commands (taking one hour to run):

```bash
python create_trainset.py --imagenet_path /path/to/your/imagenet/train --dest_dir /path/to/your/imagenet/train_50
```
Or you can download the processed trainset [here](), which contain 50K images randomly selected from ImageNet train set (~1.2M).
